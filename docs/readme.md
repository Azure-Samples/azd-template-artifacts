## What are templates?

Templates are created by Microsoft developers and community developers. The templates that are curated or organized in Microsoft collections or Microsoft GitHub organizations must adhere to all guidelines listed here; personal templates not following these guidelines will not be approved for Microsoft collections. 

## What does this document provide?

This is a living document to create more consistent criteria of what makes a template eligible to be listed in a Microsoft collection. 

There are required items and optional items in the guidelines. If an item is optional and left out, for example `app code`, it must be noted in the corresponding README. For example, “This template is a starter Bicep template with no application code.” 

## Status

This living document is in draft.
