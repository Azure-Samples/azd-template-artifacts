# Configuration guidelines

In order to make sure validation is successful in all operating systems currently tested (Linux, Windows), please make sure to add the following configuration to your template.

## Devcontainer configuration

A `devcontainer` folder with a `devcontainer.json` file, must be in place. That file must declare all necessary required installations to successfully build and deploy an application.
See an example here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azd-ai-starter/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json

## azure.yaml

The following configurations must be in place in the template's [azure.yaml](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-schema) configuration file

- Services must be correctly configured to be provisioned with the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json), according to the schema.
- To make sure cross operating system compatibility, make sure to set `docker.remoteBuild` to `true` for any containerized service, as shown in the picture below:

## CI/CD workflow for the Azure Developer CLI

All templates must check in their pipeline configuration file. To generate it, run `azd pipeline config` as described in the corresponding [documentation article](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/configure-devops-pipeline?tabs=GitHub)
