## Operational guidelines

The following guidelines are meant to help teams and contributors organize themselves and establish roles within template authoring flows.

### Template owner(s)

The template owner is the person who owns the template and acts as a point of contact to receive notification when applicable. Typically this role is filled by a core maintainer, who may or may not be code owner, but probably has some administrative persmissions in the overall repo.

### Version control

We advise teams to losely use [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) branching flows and development cycles, always branching out from default branch (default is `main`) and only integrating with a pull-request, with at least 1 reviewer. We strongly recommend you secure your default branch with as a [protected branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
