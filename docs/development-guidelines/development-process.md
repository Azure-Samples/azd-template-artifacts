## Development Guidelines - Process

For cross-functional teams working on building a template, the following guidelines are recommended.

- Create labels that reflect the different dimensions for features and operations. For example:

| Label Name | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AI         | AI implementation and implementation |
| AZD . Bicep| AZD config and Bicep related         |
| backend    | Application feature backend          |
| frontend   | Application feature frontend         |
| Docs       | Repo docs, guidelines, promo videos  |
| MSI        | Security and auth                    |
| Blocked    | Mark a task as blocked and establish dependency |
| Dependency | Establishes a dependency requirement |

These labels can be used in addition to default labels for `bug`, `enhancement`, etc


## Issues

Once the labels are in place, create issues that can be distributed and tracked to provide concise and concrete overview of progress, blockers, requests for help, etc

Assign the task to the current owner, so they can be contacted.

Use the comments in the issue to initiate a conversation, request dependecies resolution, ask for help, request clarification, etc

When applicable, use the `GitHub Projects` feature to track project completion.

## Create relevant milestones

Create milestones that issues can be assigned to so ETA can be better established and completion progress assessed.
